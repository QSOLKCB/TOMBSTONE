# TOMBSTONE roadmap

**Phases 0–6 are merged. Phase 7 hardening is implemented in this PR and awaits exact-head review and executed CI evidence. No release tag is created here.**

| Phase | Deliverable | Gate | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — Foundation | Human/machine contract and fixtures | Documentation checks | Merged |
| 1 — C99 SHA-256 | OpenSSL EVP, binary-safe C ABI | Vectors, ASan/UBSan, reproducibility | Merged |
| 2 — C99 splice | Exact witnessed byte deletion and observed transition | Adversarial inputs | Merged |
| 3 — Canonical receipts | Strict v1 JSON and SHA-256 hash chain | Golden/invalid cases | Merged |
| 4 — Rust CLI | Safe C99 FFI, deterministic headless commands | CLI parity and sanitized I/O | Merged |
| 5 — Rust TUI | ncurses inspection, optional create-new save | PTY tests and C99 parity | Merged |
| 6 — Optional GTK4 | Isolated desktop frontend over same FFI | Xvfb and independent builds | Merged |
| **7 — Hardening/release gate** | Bounded C99 fuzzing, compiler/arch replay, documented anchoring and release evidence | CI + exact-head independent review + maintainer tag decision | In PR; no tag |

## Phase 7 scope

- Clang libFuzzer targets for the bounded C99 receipt parser and exact-splice/transition APIs, instrumented with AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, with reproducible synthetic seed corpus.
- GCC and Clang compilation of the authoritative C99 backend in **independent Rust CLI builds**. Python's standard-library oracle verifies the fixed v1 schema hashes and byte-for-byte canonical JSON results without introducing a production duplicate.
- Linux x86-64 and ARM64 runner matrix for independently executed cross-compiler receipt replay, historical fixture continuity and malformed/chain negative tests.
- New [release gate](docs/RELEASE_GATE.md), [portability limits](docs/PORTABILITY.md) and [anchoring/privacy boundary](docs/ANCHORING_PRIVACY.md). No changes to existing receipt schema, output hashes, CLI or GUI contract.
- The exact PR head must receive review and green checks; the maintainer may tag a selected version **after merge** with evidence and asset checksums. No premature stable-release or secure-erasure claims.

The next action after this PR is review, any corrections, locally executed evidence where useful, and an independent **release decision**. A green CI status alone is not a release.
